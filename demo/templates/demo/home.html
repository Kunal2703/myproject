        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

        <p>
            I am writing to express my interest in the DevOps Engineer role. 
            With over 1.7 years of experience in building and managing cloud infrastructure, 
            automating CI/CD pipelines, and driving cost optimization initiatives, 
            I am confident that I can contribute effectively to your team.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my current role, I have delivered impactful solutions such as achieving a 
            <strong>25% cost reduction</strong> in production and <strong>65% in staging AWS accounts</strong> 
            through resource optimization and migration to Graviton-based instances. 
            I also architected and implemented <strong>Devtron CI/CD pipelines</strong> from scratch, 
            streamlining application deployments across staging, beta, and production environments. 
            Additionally, I successfully upgraded <strong>Amazon EKS clusters from v1.24 to v1.31</strong> 
            across multiple environments with zero downtime, ensuring business continuity while adopting 
            the latest features and security updates.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond technical problem-solving, I value collaboration and knowledge sharing. 
            I have worked closely with cross-functional teams to simplify deployments, 
            improve monitoring by migrating CloudWatch metrics to Grafana (cutting 70% monitoring costs), 
            and mentor teammates in using new tools effectively. My experience with AWS, 
            Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD tools, and scripting allows me to take ownership of complex 
            infrastructure challenges and deliver reliable, scalable solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am excited about the opportunity to join an organization that values modern technologies, 
            automation, and operational excellence. I believe my skills and passion for DevOps culture 
            align well with these goals, and I look forward to contributing to your growth 
            while advancing my own expertise.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss 
            how my experience and skills can support your teamâ€™s success.
        </p>

        <p class="signature">
            Sincerely,<br>
